This dataset was generated by the Seedlot Selection Tool (https://seedlotselectiontool.org) on {{ today }}.

The Seedlot Selection Tool is a collaboration between the US Forest Service, Oregon State University, and the Conservation Biology Institute. Initial conceptualization and development was done by Glenn Howe at Oregon State University College of Forestry and Brad St.Clair at the USFS Pacific Northwest Research Station, with considerable input from Ron Beloin while he was working at Oregon State University. The Conservation Biology Institute was brought onboard to bring the project to fruition through their expertise in web site design and programming for spatial applications. Personnel at the Conservation Biology Institute include Dominique Bachelet (project co-PI), Nikolas Stevenson-Molnar (tool developer), and Brendan Ward (project manager).

Initial funding for the Seedlot Selection Tool came from the US Forest Service Washington Office. Subsequent funding came from the USFS Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, Conservation Biology Institute, the USDA Northwest Climate Hub, and Natural Resources Canada.
